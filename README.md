Steps Taken:

1. Clone a set of files from GitHub.
2. Create an HTML table.
3. Populate the HTML table with the contents of a JSON file.
4. Create a static web server to verify the contents.
5. Utilize the CSS framework to define and then design the layout.
6. Conduct TDD (Test Driven Development) by writing code that passes HTML and JavaScript tests based on Mocha test framework.
7. Push my project into a GitHub repository.
